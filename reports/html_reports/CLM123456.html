### **INSURANCE CLAIM SUMMARY REPORT**

---

**1. Claim Overview**

*   **Claim ID:** CLM123456
*   **Policyholder:** John Doe
*   **Policy Type:** Auto Insurance
*   **Incident Date:** 2025-06-10
*   **Claimed Amount:** $4,800.00
*   **Current Status:** Pending Review

**2. Incident Description**

On June 10, 2025, the insured, John Doe, reported that his vehicle was struck from the rear by a third-party vehicle. The incident occurred while the insured's vehicle was stationary at a stoplight. The policyholder has confirmed that there were no injuries to any occupants of his vehicle as a result of the collision.

**3. Assessment**

*   **Liability:** A review of the filed police report confirms the insured's account of the incident. The report assigns 100% of the fault to the third-party driver who initiated the rear-end collision. Therefore, our policyholder is considered not at fault for this loss.
*   **Damages:** Photographic evidence submitted shows moderate damage concentrated on the rear bumper and adjacent components of the insured's vehicle. The damage is consistent with a low-speed, rear-end impact.
*   **Estimate Review:** A detailed repair estimate from a certified auto body shop has been submitted. The total estimated cost for repairs is $4,800.00, which aligns with the observed damage.

**4. Recommendation**

Based on the clear evidence of third-party liability and the reasonable repair estimate, it is recommended to:

1.  **Approve** the claim for the full amount of the repair estimate, $4,800.00.
2.  **Issue payment** directly to the policyholder or the designated repair facility upon completion of work.
3.  **Initiate subrogation** proceedings against the at-fault party's insurance carrier to recover the full cost of the claim payout.</p>
